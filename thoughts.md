Collaboration is key! And also pretty fun so far.
If you want something to happen, put it in your calendar.
I'm going to pair as much as possible, I've found it really helps to walk and talk things through with another person.
I'm committed to scheduling my breaks, otherwise I probably won't take them!
I got paired with Patrick a few times, we won't be in the same cohort unfortunately but he has a calming presence and I had fun trying to figure out git in our breakout room.
Breakout rooms are cool.
